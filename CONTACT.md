##### is this... centralization?

Not if you get involved! In the past, the bootstrap nodes have all been run by
people who are involved in the development of I2P-bote, but over time that
number has dwindled and as a result, so has the number and availability of
bootstrap nodes. Right now, the process is unfortunately centralized around a
couple of people. You can help fix that, by running an I2P-Bote bootstrap node
as a service to other users of the network.
